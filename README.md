This is a demo React app built with Redux to practice core Redux concepts and make use of the Redux Toolkit. The app demonstrates the power and flexibility of Redux by implementing a simple counter with additional functionality.📚
## What I Learned 💡
By building this demo app, I gained hands-on experience with:

- Managing data with Redux 📈
- Dispatching actions from inside components 🚀
- Integrating Redux with class-based components 🎓

## App Features
This app includes a simple counter with 4 buttons:
1. **Increment**: Increases the counter by 1.
2. **Increase by 10**: Increases the counter by 10.
3. **Decrement**: Decreases the counter by 1.
4. **Toggle Counter**: Hides or shows the counter.
The initial counter value is displayed in the middle of the screen. By clicking on these buttons, you can manipulate the counter value as described.

In addition, the app has a simple login form. Since the primary focus of this demo app is on Redux, you can log in and log out by clicking the respective buttons:
- **Log In** 🟢: Logs you in.
- **Log Out** 🔴: Logs you out.
